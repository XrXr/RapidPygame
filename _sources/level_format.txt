Level format
============

A level is a folder structure that contains the background, tile set and the landscape of the level.
For collision based levels, the structure will look like: ::

    tiles/
        1.png
        2.png
        3.png
        ...
    map
    background


The simplest level must have the map file and one image file under the tiles folder.

Tiles images must be square and have consistent file extension.

Format of *map*
---------------

A *map* file represents the landscape of the level and some of its property. It is consist of two
parts, a config portion and a data portion. The two is separated by an empty line

The config portion follows the following format:

    ``config_name config_value``
    
Here is the list of config names and their description:

* *collision*: The name of tiles that should collide with the player separated by ",".
  Each entry must be a single character or a range take looks like *"start...end"* where start start and end are both
  between 1 and 10 (inclusive)
* *gravity*: Downward acceleration of the player, in :math:`pixels/frame^2`

the simplest *map* file must contain a *collision* config

The data portion of *map* are characters that each represent a tile in the level landscape. Their
value match the names of files under the *tiles* folder. *e* is used to indicate the exit of a level
*e* character will create an exit zone that is as long as the height of the level and as wide as a tile
